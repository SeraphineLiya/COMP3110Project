# COMP3110Project
A project from University of Windsor

How It Works

All files are located in the eclipseTest folder.

Old files end with _1.java.

New files end with _2.java.

The program automatically goes through every old file, finds its matching new file, compares them, and prints the mapping.

Mapping Rule
For each line in the old file:

If it still exists in the new file → print oldLine -> newLine

If it was removed → print oldLine -> (deleted)

How to Run

Open the project in Eclipse.

Open src/project/Main.java.

Run the program using:
Run → Run As → Java Application

Line mappings for all file pairs will appear in the console.

Files Included

src/Main.java

src/LineMapper.java
